# Crusher

Crusher allows you to look at the on-site activity user and determine how the on-site activity is influenced by a users off-site browsing activity.
These are the APIs that power crusher and make it possible to analyze on-site versus off-site activity.

## Background

Crusher is a collection of analytics, machine learning and ad-buying technologies that make it possible for a user to: 

- collect information about on-site and off-site activity
- classify and understand how these behaviors influence each other
- target ads based on how these classifications differ

based on on-site and off-site activity. 

## Authorization

We need to add authorization to all of these services and remove the advertiser parameter from the API.

We will be reusing our authentication and just need to label the endpoints are authenticated in python with the appropriate decorator.

### Cookie-based

### Header-based

# On-site Activity 

These APIs allow us to search for a particular pattern or group of patterns that occur on the query string of the on-page url. 
The search APIs give us the ability to look at the following characterstics about a patterns:

- URLs: these are the URLs that match the pattern
- UIDs: these are the UIDs that match the pattern
- Count: this gives us a summary about the pattern
- Timeseries: this gives us a timeseries summary about how the pattern changes over time
