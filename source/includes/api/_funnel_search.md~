# Funnel Search

This endpoint is very similar to the multi pattern group search, in that it allows us to access the same type of information. The difference is, that the Funnel Search API takes a funnel_id as a paramater, and performs the search based on that funnel's configuration.

Similar to the the single URL search, this API support:

- the query result types: (uids,count,timeseries)
- two type of logic: (union, intersection)
